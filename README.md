this is my README file of the readme_edits branch 
intially this readme-edits branch is exactly the copy of my main 
the changes made to this branch will not be visible to my main until i merge it
the branch is used when you need to make changes to your project without them being shown in the main
commit is used to save the changes to the files in your repository
on git these saved changes are called commit
they capture the changes made by you so other contributors as well can understand what you have done and why
each commit is associated with a commit message, which is a description by you explaining why a particular change was made
